 # This file defines the input (keys and mouse) bindings of mpv and mpv.net
 # and it also defines the context menu of mpv.net. mpv.net has an input
 # editor and an config editor as alternatives to editing conf text files.
 # The input and config editor can be found in mpv.net's context menu at:

 # Settings > Show Config Editor
 # Settings > Show Input Editor

 # The defaults of this file can be found at:

 # https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/inputConf.txt

 # the defaults of mpv can be found at:

 # https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/inputConf

 # mpv.net's defaults of mpv.conf contain: 'input-default-bindings = no'
 # which disables mpv's input defaults. Every line in this file begins with a
 # space character to make it easier to do a text search, so if you want to know
 # if 'o' has already a binding you can make a text search on ' o '.
