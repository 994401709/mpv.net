# ðŸŽž mpv.net

mpv.net is a modern media player for Windows that works just like [mpv](https://mpv.io).

#### Based on libmpv

mpv.net is based on libmpv which offers a straightforward C API that was designed from the ground up to make mpv usable as a library and facilitate easy integration into other applications.

#### Command Line Interface

mpv.net has the CLI of mpv: [CLI switches](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options).

#### High quality video output

libmpv has an OpenGL based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, HDR, and more.

#### On Screen Controller

The OSC of libmpv offers play controls with a modern flat design.

#### GPU video decoding

libmpv leverages the FFmpeg hwaccel APIs to support DXVA2 video decoding acceleration.

#### Active development

mpv.net is under active development. Want a feature? Post a [patch](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/pulls) or [request it](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/issues)!

### Context Menu

The context menu can be customized via input.conf file located in the config directory:

```Text
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\mpv\input.conf
```

if it's missing mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/inputConf.txt>

input.conf defines mpv's key and mouse bindings and mpv.net uses comments to define the context menu.

### Settings

mpv.net is able to share the settings with mpv and mpv.net uses the same logic to decide from where the settings are loaded. The default location is:

```Text
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\mpv\mpv.conf
```

If a directory named portable_config next to the mpvnet.exe exists, all config will be loaded from this directory only.

```Text
<startup>\portable_config\mpv.conf
```

In case there isn't any config folder mpv.net asks where to create it. If no mpv.conf file exists mpv.net generates it with the following defaults:

<https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/blob/master/mpv.net/Resources/mpvConf.txt>

Config files located in the same directory as mpvnet.exe are loaded with lower priority. Some config files are loaded only once, which means that e.g. of 2 input.conf files located in two config directories, only the one from the directory with higher priority will be loaded.

### Scripting

[Scripting wiki page](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/wiki/Scripting)

### Add-ons

[Add-on wiki page](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/wiki/Addons)

### Architecture

mpv.net is written in C# 7.0 and runs on the .NET framework 4.7 or higher.

The Add-on implementation is based on the [Managed Extensibility Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/).

There are no specific extension or scripting interfaces but instead everyting is accessible for .NET compatible languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, Python and PowerShell), this decision was made to keep the code extremely simple and lightweight.

Python scripting is implemented with IronPython which uses Python 2.7.

The main/video window is WinForms based, all other windows are WPF based.

The config editor adds it's controls dynamically and uses TOML to define it's
content, there are only two simple types, StringSetting and OptionSetting.

mpv.net was started 2017 and consists of about 9000 lines of code.

Third party components are:

- [libmpv, the heard and soul of mpv.net](https://mpv.io/)
- [MediaInfo, no media related project could do without](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)
- [Tommy, a single file TOML parser](https://github.com/dezhidki/Tommy)
- [IronPython, bringing Python to dotnet](https://ironpython.net/)
- [CS-Script, scripting with C#](http://www.csscript.net/)
- [Everything, a blazing fast file search service](https://www.voidtools.com)
